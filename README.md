# Disease Testing App

A Quasar Framework app that helps you to understand how worried you should be if you find out that you have tested positive for a deadly disease. Maybe you should not be worried as much as you might think. It uses Baye's Rule to determine your probability of actually having the disease, given that you test positive.

The below commands allow you to build and run locally, but if you don't want to install npm or node, you can run it in the cloud using [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/quasarframework). Just point it to this repo and then run `quasar dev`.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
